Nitkazez.

## Getting Started

This is an app for friend groups who always loan from each other and someone always get screwed over.
I want to solve it by documenting each transaction for each group in a ledger, so that no one has to argue about it, and give some utilities for it (like user's balance).

This is my first flutter project so it is more of an experiement, you can see I even used both Provider and Getx.
I really think this app can be useful for kids that don't have access to money transfer apps, but still give and take money from their friends.


I haven't got around to finishing it, so I'm just uploading it now.
